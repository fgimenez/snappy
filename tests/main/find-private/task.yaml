summary: Check that find works with private snaps.

details: |
    These tests rely on the existence of a snap in the remote store set to private.

    In order to do the full checks, it also needs the credentials of the owner of that
    snap set in the environment variables SPREAD_STORE_USER and SPREAD_STORE_PASSWORD, if
    they are not present then only the negative check (private snap does not show up in
    the find results without specifying private search or without the owner logged) is
    performed.

prepare: |
    snap install --devmode expect

restore: |
    snap logout || true

execute: |
    echo "When a snap is private it doesn't show up in the find without login and without specifying private search"
    ! snap find test-snapd-private | MATCH "test-snapd-private +[0-9]+\.[0-9]+"

    echo "When a snap is private it doesn't show up in the find --private results without login"
    ! snap find test-snapd-private --private | MATCH "test-snapd-private +[0-9]+\.[0-9]+"

    echo "Given account store credentials are available"
    if [ ! -z "$SPREAD_STORE_USER" ] && [ ! -z "$SPREAD_STORE_PASSWORD" ]; then
        echo "And the user has logged in"
        expect -f successful_login.exp

        echo "Then a private snap belonging to that user shows up in the find results"
        snap find test-snapd-private --private | MATCH "test-snapd-private +[0-9]+\.[0-9]+"
