summary: Ensure that the fuse interface works.

details: |
    The fuse interfac allows a snap to manage FUSE file systems.

    A snap which defines the fuse plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to create a fuse filesystem
    in a writable zone. The fuse-consumer test snap creates a readable file with a known
    name and content in the mount point given to the command.

environment:
    BUILD_DIR: $(mktemp -d)
    MOUNT_POINT: /var/snap/fuse-consumer/current/mount_point

prepare: |
    echo "Given a snap declaring a fuse plug is installed"
    mkdir -p $BUILD_DIR
    apt install -y snapcraft
    cp -ar $TESTSLIB/snaps/fuse-consumer/* $BUILD_DIR
    cd $BUILD_DIR && snapcraft
    snap install fuse-consumer_1.0_$(dpkg-architecture -q DEB_HOST_ARCH).snap

    echo "And a user writable mount point is created"
    mkdir -p $MOUNT_POINT
    chown test:test $MOUNT_POINT

restore: |
    apt remove -y snapcraft
    apt autoremove -y
    umount $MOUNT_POINT
    rm -rf $BUILD_DIR $MOUNT_POINT fuse.error

execute: |
    CONNECTED_PATTERN=":fuse +fuse-consumer"
    DISCONNECTED_PATTERN="(?s).*?\n- +fuse-consumer:fuse"

    echo "Then the fuse plug is connected by default"
    snap interfaces | grep -Pzq "$CONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "==================================="

    echo "When the plug is connected"
    snap connect fuse-consumer:fuse ubuntu-core:fuse

    echo "Then the snap is able to create a fuse filesystem"
    sudo -i -u test /bin/sh -c "fuse-consumer.create $MOUNT_POINT"
    grep -q "Hello World!" $MOUNT_POINT/hello

    echo "==================================="

    echo "When the plug is disconnected"
    snap disconnect fuse-consumer:fuse ubuntu-core:fuse

    echo "Then the snap is not able to create a fuse file system"
    if sudo -i -u test /bin/sh -c "fuse-consumer $MOUNT_POINT 2>${PWD}/fuse.error"; then
        echo "Expected permission error creating fuse filesystem with disconnected plug"
        exit 1
    fi
    grep -q "Permission denied" fuse.error
